# Session Log

Append-only trail. One entry per working session, newest at the bottom. Tag model + date.

## 2026-08-15 — Session 1 (build origin)

- **Model:** deepseek-v4-pro (orchestration/build), deepseek-v4-flash (research subagents).
- **Decided:** build UPI/NPCI settlement reconciliation open-core (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- **Built (Phase 1):** data model (`Txn`, `Match`, `MatchStatus`, `ReconResult`,
  `Settlement`), two-pass matching engine, `match_settlements`, generic CSV loader,
  Razorpay settlement parser (real API schema).
- **Verified:** self-check 8/8 (7 file checks + CSV round-trip). Fresh verification
  script, exit 0.
- **Committed:** `ccf753b` baseline, `aad10fc` Razorpay parser, `f2a9b92`
  relocate+rename to `open source/settleflow`.
- **Repo:** relocated to `E:/Sanjay Files/StartUp/open source/settleflow`; package
  `upirecon` renamed `settleflow`.
- **Next:** Phase 2 line-item decomposition (Razorpay `Fetch Settlement Recon`).

## 2026-08-15 — Session 2 (formalize + docs + GitHub)

- **Model:** deepseek-v4-pro.
- **Did:** wrote full doc/process set (MASTER-PLAN, ARCHITECTURE, CONSTRAINTS, FLOW,
  DECISIONS, HANDOVER, BUG, FEATURE, ROLLBACK, TESTING, AGENTS, SESSION-LOG) + README
  rewrite; created the private GitHub repo and pushed.
- **Note:** Firecrawl web allowance was billing-blocked this session; research used Exa
  MCP + curl against GitHub/PyPI APIs. Recorded so future sessions do not thrash on it.
